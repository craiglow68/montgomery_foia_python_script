==================================================================================

Hello! 

To use this program, first double-click main.exe.

A window will open that asks you to choose the csv file.
   -The file must be a .csv
   -The file must have the schema: "Bill No., Balance"
   	-Note: the columns do not need to have theses names but the bill numbers 
	       need to be in the first column and the balance needs to be in the 
               second column.
   -The file needs the column names in the first row. The script
         throws out that first row. So as to not lose any data,
         please ensure the first row contains no bill numbers or balances.

In the second text box you can browse to the folder you would
    like the output file placed in. 

In the third text box you must find where you downloaded chromedriver and select 
   it. If it is the wrong file it will tell you now. If it is the wrong version of
   chromedriver it will tell you after choosing a name for your csv.

Hit OK. After hitting OK you will be asked what you'd like to name the file. 
   -The fiiename must end with .csv

The script will then open a chrome browser and get to work! You can 
do other things while the program is running so long as the browser window stays 
open. However, I cannot guarentee good performance. 

Likewise, you can split the list in two and run two or more at a time and this 
works fine. But I cannot guarentee good performance.

				                        Problems
==================================================================================
The main problem you will face is that Chrome requires the use of an application 
called "Chrome Driver" to automate its browser. Chrome Driver is updated alongside
the browser. And thus if you update your chrome browser, the chrome driver must be 
updated too. 

To fix, check your version of chrome and then go to: 
	https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
and dowload the matching chrome driver win32.zip file. 

Once downloaded, unzip the file and navigate to the program folder in a 
seperate window (The folder these instructions are in). 

The unzipped chromedriver folder will only contain an application called
"chromedriver" copy this and paste it into the program folder, replacing the 
chromedriver that is already there. 

Run the program and test it.
